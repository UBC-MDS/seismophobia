## Summary

We built a random forest classification model that predicts whether someone is afraid of earthquakes based on their demographic information. The model predicted fear of earthquakes better than a dummy classifier.

## Introduction

The damage that earthquakes cause can leave people without food, water, and shelter. Being prepared for an earthquake before it happens can make living through the immediate aftermath less traumatic (@72124acf2fa84e8aad36e68d0dc4c5e6). Having insurance that covers the damage caused by earthquakes may reduce the uncertainty and fear that the threat of earthquakes creates. People who are afraid of earthquakes represent a group of potential clients for companies selling earthquake preparedness products and insurance. It has been demonstrated that people who are more concerned about earthquakes are more likely to have taken preparatory measures, such as owning a preparedness kit [@doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00984.x].

We aim to predict groups in the population that are afraid of earthquakes and thus are target demographics for advertising. If a machine learning algorithm can identify these groups it enables companies to build a marketing strategy based on this information.

## Methods

## Data

The data for this analysis was downloaded from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/san-andreas. It is based on a survey conducted by [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) in May 2015, of 1014 respondents in the US. 

The data set contains

 - demographic information (age, gender, household income, region of residence in the United States),
 
 - responses to questions relating to knowledge of and experience with earthquakes,
 
 - self-reported level of fear of earthquakes.

Some preliminary examination of the data shows some relation between the demographic features and earthquake fear.


```{r feature_distributions, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Fig 1: Distribution of demographic information among survey respondents"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "feature_distributions.png"))
```

The survey respondents were fairly evenly split across ages categories and genders. The household income distribution was not uniform, but is likely a reflection of the US population's income distribution, that had a median value of $55,775 in 2015 [@bureau_2018].  The distribution across US regions was not uniform, possibly due to the fact that the list of regions is divided into geographic regions that don't necessarily have the same populations. For example, the Pacific region (Washington, Oregon, and California) has a population of 50.1 million compared to New England (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) has a combined population of 14.7 million [@bureau_2019].

```{r feature_distributions_across_response, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Fig 2: The level of earthquake fear across demograhic features"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "feature_distributions_across_response.png"))
```
Younger people tend to report being afraid more often than older people, while women report being afraid more often than men. The geographic region with the highest level of fear is the Pacific. Overall there were more people who were not afraid of earthquakes than were afraid.

```{r target_distribution, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "25%", fig.cap = "Fig 3: The distribution of earthquake fear among respondents"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "target_distribution.png"))
```



## Analysis

We used a random forest classifier for the prediction task. In addition to binary classification for prediction, random forest classifier gives a measure of importance for each feature. We chose to use only the demographic variables as model features because they are readily available in census data without having to conduct a separate, more task-specific survey. The prediction target is the self-reported fear of earthquakes, which we converted from an ordinal variable to a binary variable called `target`. The class `target` = 0 includes the levels _"not at all worried"_ and _"not so worried"_, while `target` = 1 includes _"somewhat worried"_, _"very worried"_, and _"extremely worried"_.  


## Results

Our model was a random forest classifier which we compared to a dummy classifier that assigned a class randomly based on the target distribution. Our model had correctly predicted more negative outcomes, with fewer false positives than the dummy classifier. However it correctly predicted fewer positive outcomes (people afraid of earthquakes) than the dummy classifier and had more false negatives.


```{r confusion_matrices, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", out.height="40%", fig.cap="Fig 4: Confusion matrix for dummy classifier and random forest classifier",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(here::here("visuals", "confusion_matrix_DummyClassifier.png"),
                          here::here("visuals", "confusion_matrix_RandomForestClassifier.png")))
``` 

The combined effects of higher precision and lower recall resulted in a slightly higher F1 scores for our model than the dummy classifier. 

```{r classifier_results_table, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", out.height="30%", fig.cap="Fig 5: Classifier F1 scores",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "classifier_results_table.png"))
``` 

Of the model's positive predictions, a greater proportion were correct than the dummy classifier's, as characterized by our model's higher *ROC AUC*. The model predicted better than if it was guessing at random, but not a by lot.


```{r roc_curves, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Fig 6: ROC curves for dummy classifier and random forest classifier",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c(here::here("visuals", "roc_auc_curve_DummyClassifier.png"),
                          here::here("visuals", "roc_auc_curve_RandomForestClassifier.png")))
``` 

The features that were most important in the prediction task were household income, living in the Pacific region, and age. (How much interpretation can we do based on these feature importances? This will be discussed more next week)



```{r feature importance, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", out.height="80%", fig.cap="Fig 7: Feature importance in random forest classifier",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("visuals", "feature_importance.png"))
``` 

Our model does not seem to be very effective in identifying people who are afraid of earthquakes. A different type of model, such as logistic regression may yield better results, as well as dealing with the class imbalance. The greatest potential for improvement lies in obtaining a more comprehensive data set that contains more demographic features and a larger sample size.

The R [@R] and Python [@van1995python] programming languages and the following Python packages were used for this project: pandas [@reback2020pandas], sklearn [@scikit-learn], tidyverse [@tidyverse], and knitr [@knitr].
